Project Lie to Me, by Alexander Bennett, and Caitlin Wurz

Project Lie to Me is an effort to identify deception based on amplified and filtered video. The premise of this project is based on the fact that people are unable to surpress micro-expressions when they are under the emotional stress of deception.
